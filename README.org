#+TITLE: Some basic algorithms for stochastic differential equations in NumPy (Python 3)

This is an updated version of the 2013 work presented by Dr Alexander Lundervold (http://alexander.lundervold.com/) in GitHub (see https://github.com/alu042/SDE-higham) and the MatLab files Prof Des Higham (https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~dhigham/) makes available in his homepage (https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~dhigham/algfiles.html). 
The code we present here is the respective code found on those two locations updated/converted to run in Python 3.

* Overview
Modified from the MATLAB versions in

Details about the algorithms can be found in the paper.
